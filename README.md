## struct

For example:
An Employee struct is declared in line no. 7. A method named LeavesRemaining is added to the Employee struct in line no. 14. This calculates and displays the number of remaining leaves an employee has. Now we have a struct and a method that operates on a struct bundled together akin to a class.
